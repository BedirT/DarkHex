\section{Background}

Here we will build up the knowledge we need to read the rest of the thesis. We start
with the notations and definitions we use. Mainly we have three major topics; 
Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Counterfactual Regret
Minimization (CFR). We will follow this path in this section too, first we will explain
extensive form and imperfect-information games. Then we will explain Hex and Dark Hex 
briefly. As Dark Hex is not well documented and very scarce in the literature, we count
it as a contribution, therefor there will be a seperate chapter discussing the properties
and details of the game. After the games we will introduce RL and the RL algorithms we used.
Lastly we will have a CFR section which includes the explanation of CFR and all it's variants
we found useful for our experiments.
