\subsection{Definitions (Maybe on background instead)}

\textbf{Game ---} Game in Game Theory is defined as a set of states which has a result dependent on the actions of the players. Since we are mostly concerned on computational needs and limitations; we will accept a slightly different definition instead. A \textbf{game} is a series of actions taken by two or more players which result in a different state for every action. This definition is more complete for our purposes, since we consider information state rather then individual board states. For example;

\vspace{12px}
\centerline{player2 =
$\left\{
\begin{tabular}{@{}l@{}}
    . \hspace{3px} .\\
    \hspace{5px} . \hspace{1px} W
\end{tabular}
\right\}\neq
\left\{
\begin{tabular}{@{}l@{}}
    B \hspace{1px} .\\
    \hspace{5px} . \hspace{1px} W
\end{tabular}
\right\}$}

Here player2(W)'s information state changes depending if the move tried hits a black stone prior to a legal move or not. \ref{lanctot2009monte}
