# DarkHex

Dark Hex is the imperfect information version of the game Hex.
The game has interesting properties but lacking research on it.
This repository includes my implementation of the game along with
the classical Hex. Also my write ups and literature on my thesis
on the topic. I am currently using open-spiel for running the
algorithms, but eventually I will have the specific algorithms
implemented here.
