# DarkHex

Dark Hex is the imperfect information version of the game Hex. This game has a really scarce work on it. In this repository I am including an implementation of the game along with some algorithms implemented specifically for DarkHex. Also I included the results of some of the experiments.

For details on DarkHex and any of the algorithms used as well as the experiments please check my thesis [-link-]().
